Resource Agnostic Components


Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The aim of this mod is to make all JS Simulation Components resource
agnostic - that is to say, that they do not have the game's resources
hard-coded into them.

This is so that modders can add/remove resources easily and without
having to modify the simulation code.

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Acquire zip from GitHub (button marked "Download ZIP")
2. Move to your mods folder, default locations are:
   - Linux   : ~/.local/share/0ad/mods
   - OSX     : ~/Library/Application\ Support/0ad/mods
   - Windows : "Documents" or "My Documents" Folder => My Games\0ad\mods\
3. Unzip archive
4. Rename the resulting folder to "ResourceAgnostic"
5. Start 0AD
6. From main menu, "Tools & Options" > "Mod Selection"
7. Select "ResourceAgnostic" from upper section
8. Press buttons captioned with "Enable", "Save Configuration", and then
   "Start Mods" in that order

Scripting Notes
------------------------------------------------------------------------
To add an new resource, copy one of the currently existing resources in
`simulation/data/resources` and amend the copy to your heart's content.

To remove a resource, add `.DELETED` to the end of the resource's JSON
file.
